# Design Patterns and UML
We introduced UML class diagrams. UML (Unified Markup Language) was designed in the 1990's to help document object oriented
systems in pictures. Many coders, not all, will find this technique more effective than code or pseudocode. From a UML class
diagram it's possible to write the basic framework of the C# classes and interfaces, including their inheritance relationships,
field declarations and method signatures.

There are several tools available to create UML diagrams using a script. One is [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/class-diagram). Click on Oneline Server or any of the example diagrams to open an editor. These scripts can then be pasted into markdown documents and the diagrams can be rendered in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code using extensions.

Design Patterns are a common language within many coding teams, and often asked about in interviews. A pattern is simply a recurring solution style, and a knowledge of patterns provides a source of ideas so that we can avoid re-inventing the wheel. The [Design Patterns pdf](./design_patterns.pdf) is my cheatsheet in interview preparations. Alongside Patters are Principles. These include SOLID principles such as Dependency Inversion, which follows the philosphy of the Dependency Injection technique that ASP.NET uses which we talked about last week. The Service Locator patterns is another example which can be used when there is no container such as ASP.NET to do this for us.

We can only cover these at a very broad level at this stage, but with coming project work, we will envounter these patterns in practice and become comfortable in talking about them,
